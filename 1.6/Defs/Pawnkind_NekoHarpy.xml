    <!--Usually biocoded! No stealing neko-harpy gear!
    
    Using biocoded  items is often a good idea for balancing high-tech factions which the player can encounter at day one as it prevents the  players
    from instantly becoming a high-tech faction just by defeating a few high-tech pawns.
    The Empire from Royalty uses the DeathAcidifier a lot but is fairly generous with rare biocoding of weapons, but since they aren't hostile early-game,
    it is usually less of an issue.

  <!--
  In practice I'd advise forcing particular outfits, colors, etc. for your raiders. Vanilla's randomness does not make for a very coherent faction, and
  will make your raiders look like the same hodgepodge of random stuff that vanilla and every other mod does.

  For more proper examples of pawnkind designs for raiders with some coherence, etc. look at mods like Big & Small Races,
  or the VIPER faction of Big & Small Lamia mod.
